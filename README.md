# WakeVision
WakeVision is a computer vision system that detects driver drowsiness by monitoring eye closure using MobileNet-based deep learning. Alerts the driver when drowsiness is detected, enhancing road safety. Implemented with Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow to combine real-time video processing with machine learning.
